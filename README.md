# 🧠 CNN Projects Collection

Welcome to my collection of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) projects! This repository serves as a central hub for my experiments, implementations, and applications of Deep Learning in Computer Vision.

## 📂 Projects Overview

Here you will find various projects ranging from fundamental concepts to advanced applications.

| Project Name | Description | Status |
|--------------|-------------|--------|
| **[MNIST Digit Classifier](MNIST_CNN.ipynb)** | A classic entry-level project to classify handwritten digits using a custom CNN architecture. | ✅ Completed |
| **[Fruit Disease Classifier](fruitnetsh-disease-classifier.ipynb)** | A deep learning model designed to identify diseases in fruits (FruitNet). | ✅ Completed |

## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools

- **Languages:** Python 🐍
- **Frameworks:** TensorFlow / Keras, PyTorch
- **Libraries:** NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, OpenCV, Scikit-learn
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebooks, Google Colab

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/CNN-Projects.git
   cd CNN-Projects
   ```

2. **Set up the environment:**
   It is recommended to use a virtual environment.
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Explore the Notebooks:**
   Launch Jupyter Notebook to explore the projects:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

## 📈 Future Goals

- Implement Transfer Learning with state-of-the-art models (ResNet, VGG, EfficientNet).
- Explore Object Detection (YOLO, SSD).
- Image Segmentation tasks (U-Net).
- Deploy models using Flask/FastAPI or Streamlit.
